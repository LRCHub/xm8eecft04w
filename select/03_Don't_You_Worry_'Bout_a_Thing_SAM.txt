Lyrics

Mhhm, mhm, yeah
Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reachin' out in vain
Just takin' the things not worth having

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standin' on the side
When you check it out, oh

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
Just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Come on
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new, yeah
You're the only one to sees
The changes you take yourself through
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-uuuh

Don't you worry 'bout a thing (A-a-ayy)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (A-a-ayy)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (A-a-ayy)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (A-a-ayy)

Oh!
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standin' on the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standin' on the side
When you check it out
Don't you worry

Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standin' (I'll be standin' for you)
Ooh, ooh
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
