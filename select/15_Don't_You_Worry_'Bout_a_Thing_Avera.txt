Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (oh 'bout a thing)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing mama (ohh about a thing)
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But Just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

Don't you worry 'bout a thing (oh 'bout a thing)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing mama (ohh about a thing)
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get it off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-ra-pa-ra-rup-po-ro-ro-ro
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-ra-pa-ra-rup-po-ro-ro-ro-rum-pa-ra
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (oh 'bout a thing)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing pretty mama (ohh about a thing)
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get it off your trip
Eh everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to sees
The changes you take yourself through
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (oh 'bout a thing)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing pretty mama (ohh about a thing)
Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out
Eh don't you worry 'bout a th-ing
Don't you worry 'bout a th-ing
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-ra-pa-ra-rup-po-ro-ro-ro
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-ra-pa-ra-rup-po-ro-ro-ro-rum-pa-ra
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
End.
